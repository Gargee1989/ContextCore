## 1. Introduction

### 1.1 Purpose
This document specifies the software requirements for a browser/PDF-reader extension that provides **context-aware word and phrase meanings** for readers of digital books (PDF/e-book format). It is intended to guide the development team, evaluators, and stakeholders through the functional and non-functional requirements of the Minimum Viable Product (MVP) and its subsequent scaled version.

### 1.2 Document Conventions
- "The system" refers to the Context-Aware PDF Reader Extension.
- Priority levels: **High**, **Medium**, **Low**.
- Requirement IDs follow the format `FR-XX` (Functional Requirement) and `NFR-XX` (Non-Functional Requirement).
- "TBD" marks sections the team will complete manually.

### 1.3 Intended Audience and Reading Suggestions
- **Developers** — Sections 3 and 4 for interface and feature requirements.
- **Project mentors / evaluators** — Sections 1 and 2 for scope and rationale.
- **Product/business stakeholders** — Section 2.2, 2.3 and Appendix (business model).
Reading order: Sections 1 → 2 → 3 → 4 → 5 sequentially.

### 1.4 Product Scope
The product is a lightweight extension (browser extension and/or in-app PDF viewer plugin) that lets a reader select any word or phrase inside a PDF/e-book and instantly view its **contextual meaning** — i.e., the definition as it applies to the surrounding sentence, paragraph, or chapter — without leaving the page or opening a new tab.

**Objective:** Reduce reading interruption caused by dictionary look-ups, thereby improving reading speed, comprehension, and completion rate of chapters/books.

**Out of scope for MVP:** audiobook narration, handwriting/annotation tools, multi-language translation (may be a future phase), full offline LLM inference.

## 2. Overall Description

### 2.1 Product Perspective
The system is a **new, standalone product** delivered as:
1. A browser extension (Chrome/Edge, Manifest V3) that overlays on PDF files opened in-browser, **and/or**
2. A lightweight web-based PDF reader (hosted app) with the same capability built in.

It integrates with a third-party Large Language Model (LLM) API to generate context-aware definitions, rather than relying on a static dictionary database alone.

### 2.2 Product Functions (High-Level)
- Detect and capture a word/phrase selected by the user inside a rendered PDF.
- Extract surrounding context (sentence/paragraph/page) around the selection.
- Send the word + context to an LLM API and retrieve a contextual definition.
- Display the definition inline (tooltip/side-panel) without a new tab or page navigation.
- Cache previously looked-up words per document to reduce repeated API calls.
- Track reading engagement metrics (pages read, time per page) for future scaling/analytics.

### 2.3 User Classes and Characteristics
| User Class | Description | Technical Expertise |
|---|---|---|
| Students (primary) | College/school students reading textbooks/novels as PDFs | Low–Medium |
| Casual e-book readers | General readers of fiction/non-fiction PDFs | Low |
| Educators (secondary) | May recommend the tool to students | Medium |

### 2.4 Operating Environment
- **Client side:** Modern Chromium-based browsers (Chrome, Edge, Brave) — Manifest V3 extension environment; OR a responsive web app accessible via any modern browser.
- **Server side:** Cloud-hosted backend (e.g., Node.js/Python) deployed on a serverless or lightweight VM platform (Vercel/Render/Railway for MVP).
- **Third-party dependency:** LLM API (Anthropic Claude API / OpenAI API / Gemini API — team to finalize).

### 2.5 Design and Implementation Constraints
- Must work within a **5-day MVP build timeline**.
- Must operate at **zero/low cost** for the end user (student-facing free tier).
- LLM API usage costs must be optimized (e.g., short context windows, caching, rate limiting).
- Must not require the user to open a new browser tab for a lookup.
- Extension must comply with Chrome Web Store Manifest V3 policies (no remote code execution beyond permitted patterns).

### 2.6 User Documentation
- A short in-app onboarding tooltip (first-use tutorial) explaining "select a word → see contextual meaning."
- A README/help page hosted alongside the extension listing.

### 2.7 Assumptions and Dependencies
- Assumes the PDF text layer is selectable (i.e., not a scanned/image-only PDF, unless OCR is added later).
- Assumes availability and uptime of the chosen third-party LLM API.
- Assumes users have an active internet connection (no offline mode in MVP).

## 3. External Interface Requirements

### 3.1 User Interfaces
- **Selection popup:** Appears within ~1–2 seconds of word/phrase selection, positioned near the cursor, non-blocking of surrounding text.
- **Side panel (optional/Phase 2):** Persistent panel showing lookup history for the current chapter.
- Minimalist design — no more than 2 primary actions visible in the popup (e.g., "Show meaning," "Save word").

### 3.2 Hardware Interfaces
Not applicable — software-only product running on standard consumer laptops/desktops (and mobile browser, if extended later).

### 3.3 Software Interfaces
- **PDF Rendering Engine:** PDF.js (or equivalent) to extract text and coordinate positions.
- **LLM API:** RESTful API calls (HTTPS, JSON request/response) to a contextual-definition endpoint.
- **Browser Extension APIs:** `chrome.tabs`, `chrome.scripting`, `chrome.storage` (for caching).

### 3.4 Communications Interfaces
- HTTPS for all client–server and server–LLM API communication.
- JSON as the data interchange format.

## 4. System Features

*(This section defines core MVP features. Team to append additional feature sub-sections manually as marked.)*

### 4.1 Feature: Contextual Word/Phrase Lookup
**Priority:** High
**Description:** Reader selects/drags over a word or short phrase in the PDF; the system displays its meaning as interpreted within the surrounding sentence/paragraph/chapter context — not a generic dictionary definition.

**Functional Requirements:**
- **FR-01:** The system shall detect a text selection event within the rendered PDF viewer.
- **FR-02:** The system shall extract the selected word/phrase plus a configurable window of surrounding text (e.g., ±2 sentences or the current paragraph) as context.
- **FR-03:** The system shall send the word and context to the LLM API and request a concise, context-specific definition.
- **FR-04:** The system shall display the returned definition in an inline popup within 3 seconds under normal network conditions.
- **FR-05:** The system shall NOT open a new browser tab or navigate away from the current page during lookup.
- **FR-06:** The system shall cache word+context lookups locally per document session to avoid duplicate API calls for repeated selections.

### 4.2 Feature: Reading Session Tracking (for scaling/analytics)
**Priority:** Medium
**Functional Requirements:**
- **FR-07:** The system shall log pages read and time spent per session (locally or to backend, per privacy policy).
- **FR-08:** The system shall allow the user to view basic reading progress (e.g., pages completed vs. planned).

### 4.3 Feature: Feedback Collection
**Priority:** Medium
**Functional Requirements:**
- **FR-09:** The system shall provide a lightweight in-app feedback form/button.
- **FR-10:** The system shall NOT request payment; feedback shall be the sole "currency" requested from users in the MVP phase.

## 5. Other Nonfunctional Requirements

### 5.1 Performance Requirements
- **NFR-01:** Contextual definition response time shall not exceed 3 seconds (95th percentile) under normal load.
- **NFR-02:** The extension shall not increase PDF page load time by more than 500ms.

### 5.2 Safety Requirements
Not applicable (no physical safety risk).

### 5.3 Security Requirements
- **NFR-03:** All API communication shall be encrypted via HTTPS/TLS.
- **NFR-04:** No user document content shall be stored on the server beyond the transient context needed for a single API call, unless the user explicitly opts into cloud sync.
- **NFR-05:** API keys shall never be exposed in client-side code.

### 5.4 Software Quality Attributes
- **Usability:** A second-year engineering student or a non-technical reader should be able to use the core feature without instructions, within their first lookup attempt.
- **Reliability:** Graceful fallback message if the LLM API is unavailable (e.g., "Definition service temporarily unavailable — try again").
- **Portability:** Core logic separated from browser-specific code to allow future porting to Firefox/mobile.
- **Maintainability:** Modular codebase (separate modules for PDF parsing, context extraction, API integration, UI rendering).

### 5.5 Business/Operational Requirements
- **NFR-06:** The product shall be free of cost for student users in the MVP and initial scaling phase.
- **NFR-07:** The system shall include a feedback mechanism visible on every screen/session, used to prioritize the product roadmap.
